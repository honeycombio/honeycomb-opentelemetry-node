            We require pull request titles to follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and it looks like your proposed title needs to be adjusted.
            Make sure to prepend with "feat:", "fix:", or another option in the list below.
            Once you update the title, this workflow will re-run automatically and validate the updated title.
            Details:

            ```
            ${{ steps.lint_pr_title.outputs.error_message }}
            ```

      # Delete a previous comment when the issue has been resolved
      - if: ${{ steps.lint_pr_title.outputs.error_message == null }}
